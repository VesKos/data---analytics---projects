# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of my data analytics projects, showcasing skills in Python, interactive dashboards, and reporting tools.

## 🐍 Python Projects

All Python scripts (Jupyter notebooks) are located in the `main` folder.  

The project **Python_FilmSearch** includes data processing, analysis, and automation scripts, demonstrating practical Python programming skills.  

> ⚠️ Note: The file `settings_bot.py` containing sensitive information (such as tokens) is **not included** in the repository for security reasons.  
> To run the project, create this file manually in the project root and add the required variables, e.g.:  
> ```python
> TOKEN = "your_token"
> ```

## 📊 Interactive Dashboards

Power BI, Tableau, and Google Sheets files are hosted externally due to file size limitations.  
All dashboards are fully interactive (except Google Sheets). 
For a demonstration of their functionality, please feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vesna-kostrewa-7118125a/).
