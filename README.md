# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of my data analytics projects, showcasing skills in Python, interactive dashboards, and reporting tools.

## Python Projects

All Python scripts (Jupyter notebooks) are located in the `main` folder.  

The project "Python_FilmSearch" includes data processing, analysis, and automation scripts demonstrating practical Python programming skills.
The file settings_bot.py containing sensitive information (such as tokens) is not included in the repository for security reasons.
To run the project, create this file manually in the project root and add the required variables (TOKEN = "your_token").

## Interactive Dashboards

Due to file size limitations, Power BI and Tableau files are hosted externally.  
You can explore the interactive dashboards using the following links:
